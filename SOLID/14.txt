Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle advises that “no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use”.

Put differently, it's better to have many small, specific interfaces than a few monolithic ones that try to do everything.

For us,
In our notification system, INotifier has just one method send(...). This interface is already as segregated as it can get – each notifier class implements exactly what it needs. We don't have a case where, say, EmailSender is forced to implement an unrelated method. So our design for notifiers already follows ISP.

ISP is like SRP but for interfaces
