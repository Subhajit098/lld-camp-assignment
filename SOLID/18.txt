Step 1: What is DIP (in simple words)?

DIP stands for: Dependency Inversion Principle — the ‘D’ in SOLID principles.

Here’s the plain English version:

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions (like interfaces).

And also:

Abstractions should not depend on details.
Details should depend on abstractions.
