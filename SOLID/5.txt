Isn’t it just better !!

Now each class has a clear responsibility. EmailSender handles only emails, and SMSSender handles only SMS. The NotificationService is simpler – it just decides which sender to use and delegates the call.

After applying SRP, the notification system is split into specialized classes. The NotificationService uses EmailSender and SMSSender to handle the details of each channel. Each class has a single responsibility (one job), which makes the code easier to maintain and extend.
