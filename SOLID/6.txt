How to remove the if else SYSTEM 

"OPEN CLOSED Principle"

📖 Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open-Closed Principle says that classes and other entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

In practice, this means we should design our classes so that we can add new functionality (extend them) without changing the existing code.

We often achieve this by using abstraction and polymorphism .



Looking at our NotificationService
adding a new notification type currently requires changing its code (not closed for modification). We can apply OCP by introducing an abstraction for "notification sending".


Plan: Applying OCP
Define an abstract base class or interface (in C++ terms, an abstract class with a pure virtual function) for senders, say INotifier, with a method like send(const User&, const std::string&).

Have EmailSender and SMSSender (and any future senders) inherit from INotifier and implement the send method.

Change NotificationService to use INotifier references or pointers instead of concrete EmailSender/SMSSender. For example, NotificationService might have a method to accept any INotifier and invoke its send method, or maintain a list of INotifier objects to send through all available channels.

This plan outlines how to use the INotifier abstraction to make the NotificationService open for extension (new senders) but closed for modification (no change to NotificationService needed).
