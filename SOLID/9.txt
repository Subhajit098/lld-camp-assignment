What is Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?

Definition (in plain English):

If class B is a subclass (derived) of class A, then objects of A should be replaceable with objects of B without breaking the correctness of the program.

Or simply:

A subclass should behave like its parent class — not change or break expectations.

🧠 Intuition

Think of inheritance like a “is-a” relationship.
If B is a type of A, then wherever A is expected, we should be able to use B without problems.

If replacing the base class object with a derived class object causes weird or wrong behavior, LSP is violated.
