summary : 

With the SOLID principles applied, our design is significantly improved:
SRP: Each class has a single responsibility.

OCP: The system can be extended with new notifiers without modifying existing code.

LSP: Subclasses (notifiers) can substitute for the base (INotifier) reliably.

ISP: Interfaces are small and focused (just one method here).

DIP: High-level logic depends on an abstraction (INotifier), not concrete classes.
